# Air Quality API Project

I am learning React from Jonas Steadman on Udemy.  
This app uses the _Air Matters_ API ([https://dev.air-matters.com](https://dev.air-matters.com)) for data fetching and displaying it to users.

**This project uses Vite**.

## Usage

Type the name of the place you want to get the air qualitry of. One second after you stop typing, the app will send the fetch request and populate the list of places found SELECT box.

Click on the box and click on the location you want to see the data for.

> I am using the free tier for the app since this is a learning project, so it is limited to 1,000 requests per day.
